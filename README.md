PROJECT MILESTONE 02


## 1. DATASET DESCRIPTION 

New South Wales Health Ministry provides an open portal for datasets of the reported cases of individuals who acquired COVID-19 in Australia (usual residence only not necessarily where the virus is contracted). As defined, a confirmed case is an individual who tested positive to in terms of the COVID-19 virus. The test was done through the identification of virus with the use of electron microscopy or if possible in a form of viral culture at a recorded laboratory. Each test results were later on recorded to the dataset. The number of reported cases for a specified notification date may vary for a period of time due to the daily basis of recording information. The gathered dataset is used for assessment in the measurement of risks identifying an individual and also the level of sensitivity. The dataset was used in mitigation of risks that includes suppressing and aggregating the  data. The dataset in a csv format is composed of 63,024 rows and 6 columns. Each column of the COVID-19 reported cases is represented by variables such as notification date, postcode, local health district, and local government areas. I speculate that column lhd_2010_code is related to lhd_2010_name since it provides the area code and name of where the virus is contracted. The dataset was obtained from the open source data of the New South Wales (NSW) Government Website under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. The data were collected in the year of 2020 and is updated until September 2021. 

## 2. TOPIC AND INTEREST IN THE DATASET
Since the gathered dataset is composed of several entries, the main interest that we can do out of it is the analysis and prediction of the virus trend. Data analysis and visualisation goes hand in hand. As far as there is an analysis, there would be data visualization. The main interest of obtaining this dataset is to provide a timely and relevant analysis of the given dataset. Upon the analysis, there would be missing data, that is why it is necessary to clean the data. The dataset obtained from the NSW Government is quite intriguing as it is relevant in today's situation. Being knowledgeable in data analysis and prediction of the virus trend is quite interesting, in a way that you will be knowledgeable to the possible trends of infection. In addition, the analysis can help to identify which location has the highest reported cases of COVID-19. With regards to data visualization, it is critical to visualise the given sets of data. It serves as a key to identify certain factors and aspects relative to the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. On the other hand, a dashboard can be produced once the analysis of data is completed. By the use of the given dataset, the analyst aims to seek answers to the following questions: 

1.	Which part of Australia has the highest number of COVID-19 cases?
2.	Which part of Australia has the lowest number of COVID-19 cases?
3.	By the analysis of the data, how can we predict the future trend of the virus?
4.	Which location is expected to have an increase in the reported cases? 
5.	How can we visualize a large amount of datasets?
6.	How can we present the results of data in a form of dashboard?
